# Readme of catkin_iiwa

## Note 

This workspace was created by Liu Xu and uses the open source library on Github: [iiwa_ros](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/iiwa_ros/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file)

You can simulate the iiwa manipulator by running `roslaunch iiwa_gazebo iiwa_gazebo.launch`, and you can switch control mode.
